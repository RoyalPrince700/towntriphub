ðŸš€ New Project Alert: TownTripHub - Transforming Transportation in The Gambia

I'm excited to share that an international client recently reached out to me via WhatsApp with an opportunity to build a comprehensive transportation platform. What started as a WhatsApp message has now become an exciting MERN stack project I'm developing.

The platform aims to revolutionize transportation services in The country by connecting verified users with trusted drivers and logistics personnel, addressing real transportation challenges in both urban and rural communities.

Key Features in Development:
â€¢ Secure user authentication with Google OAuth integration
â€¢ Real-time ride booking and goods delivery services
â€¢ Comprehensive verification system for drivers and logistics personnel
â€¢ Interactive dashboards for users, drivers, and service providers
â€¢ Manual payment system with payment tracking
â€¢ Rating and review system for quality assurance
â€¢ Admin panel for system management

Tech Stack: React + Vite (Frontend) | Node.js + Express.js + MongoDB (Backend) | JWT Authentication | Cloudinary for file uploads | Mailtrap for email services

It's incredibly rewarding to work on projects that directly impact local communities. The WhatsApp conversation that sparked this project reminds me why I love building technology solutions that solve real-world problems.
